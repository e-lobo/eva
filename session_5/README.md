## Target:

1.   Addition of Image Augmentation (Random Rotation).
2.   Addition of GAP (Global Average Pooling) layer to the network.

## Results:


1.   Parameters: 10,308
2.   Best Training Accuracy: 99.26%
3.   Best Test Accuracy: 99.31%

## Conclusion 

*   Model is over-fitting

# [Step 4](step_4/README.md) :

## Target:

1. Addition of Image Augmentation (Random Rotation).
2. Addition of GAP (Global Average Pooling) layer to the network.
3. Addition of scheduler.

## Results:

1. Parameters: 8,016
2. Best Training Accuracy: 99.27
3. Best Test Accuracy: 99.41%

## Conclusion

* Model is not over-fitting
* Less than 10k params used.
